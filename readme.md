An engine by Amy Wilder designed for playing games without hacking them, by reading pixels on the screen and providing inputs.
Does not use pretrained/neural AI, only hard-coded decision trees.

**DO NOT USE IN ANY WAY THAT HARMS THE FUN OF OTHERS, UNDERMINES PUBLIC MULTIPLAYER FAIRNESS, EXPLOITS REWARD SYSTEMS, OR FALSIFIES SPEEDRUN RECORDS IN UNASSISTED CATEGORIES. USING MACROS DOES NOT MAKE YOU A BETTER PLAYER, AND USING A SCRIPT TO RUIN OTHER PEOPLES' FUN MAKES YOU A PATHETIC LOSER.**

**This tool is designed explicitly for the personal fun of solving puzzles algorithmically instead of basing it on execution.**
